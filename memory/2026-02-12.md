## Durable notes

- Bootstrapped assistant identity and user preferences:
  - Assistant name: BartBot
  - User name: Alejandro
  - Preferred style: casual, precise, intelligent
  - Preferred language: Spanish
- Initialized git in workspace and committed identity files.
- Connected repo to GitHub: `https://github.com/avbartolomeo/bartbot`.
- Resolved push issues (missing git identity, HTTPS auth/PAT permissions).
- Workspace cleanup commit created locally (`7123887`): added AGENTS/SOUL/TOOLS/HEARTBEAT and memory file; removed bootstrap file.
- Telegram issue diagnosed: plugin was disabled in config (`plugins.entries.telegram.enabled=false`) even though channel config existed.
- Re-enabled Telegram plugin via gateway config patch and restarted gateway; Telegram replies confirmed working.
- Security/auth operational decision:
  - Move away from interactive PAT prompts.
  - Chosen approach: SSH deploy key dedicated to this host/repo.
  - Generated key: `~/.ssh/bartbot_github_ed25519` and switched git remote to SSH (`git@github.com:avbartolomeo/bartbot.git`).
  - Pending user step: add public key as GitHub deploy key with write access on `avbartolomeo/bartbot`.
